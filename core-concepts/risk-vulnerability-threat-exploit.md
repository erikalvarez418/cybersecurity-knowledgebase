# Risk vs Vulnerability vs Threat vs Exploit

These four terms are often confused, but they describe different parts of the cybersecurity puzzle. Understanding them helps you assess and manage security more effectively.

---

## Definitions

### Threat
A **threat** is any potential danger that could harm your system or data.

> Example: A hacker attempting to break into your network.

---

### Vulnerability
A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

> Example: An unpatched server running outdated software.

---

### Exploit
An **exploit** is a technique or piece of code that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

> Example: A remote code execution (RCE) exploit used to take control of a web server.

---

### Risk
**Risk** is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

> Example: If an attacker exploits a known bug in your system, the risk might be loss of sensitive customer data.

## How They Relate

Threat + Vulnerability + Exploit = Risk

If any one of the elements is missing, the level of risk is reduced:

| Element Missing | Result |
|------------------|--------|
| No Threat | No danger to exploit the vulnerability |
| No Vulnerability | Threat can't get in |
| No Exploit | Vulnerability may not be used |
| Risk Managed | Reduced likelihood or impact |

---

## Real-World Example

| Concept | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Threat | A cybercriminal |
| Vulnerability | Outdated web server with known CVE |
| Exploit | Script that leverages the CVE to gain access |
| Risk | Breach of sensitive data and reputational damage |

---

**Pro Tip**: Regularly patching systems, using security tools, and conducting risk assessments help reduce exposure.
