# 🔐 The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity. It stands for:

- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

These three principles guide how we protect information and systems.

---

## 🔒 Confidentiality

**Goal**: Prevent unauthorized access to data.

### ✅ Examples:
- Encryption of files or communication (e.g., HTTPS, AES).
- Strong passwords and access control.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### ❌ Breach Example:
- A hacker stealing customer credit card data from a breached database.

---

## 🧬 Integrity

**Goal**: Ensure data is accurate and unaltered.

### ✅ Examples:
- Checksums and hashes (e.g., SHA-256).
- Digital signatures.
- Access logs to detect tampering.

### ❌ Breach Example:
- An attacker modifying the content of a financial transaction.

---

## 🔁 Availability

**Goal**: Keep systems and data accessible when needed.

### ✅ Examples:
- Redundant systems and backups.
- DDoS protection.
- Disaster recovery plans.

### ❌ Breach Example:
- A DDoS attack making a website or server unavailable.

## 💡 Why It Matters

The CIA Triad is used to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls. Every security measure should support at least one of these pillars.
